## Introductions

	Jack:
		Hi, I'm Jack...

	Barry:
		and I'm Barry, and we're front-end engineers and codevelopers of the cranky cartographer,
		an application for mapping and sharing trails.

## Story

	Barry:
		I came up with the idea a couple of summers ago while I was hiking the Appalachian Trail.
		When far from civilization, having access to distances, elevation data, and the locations of
		shelters, water sources, and locations for resupply is critical.  Luckily, I had an AT
		guide, a booklet with all this information available, but most trails aren't as well
		documented, and even the AT guide requires yearly updates because of how often the trail
		changes.  This inspired us to make an app that allows users to plan chart trails anywhere
		in the world while also being easily-updatable.  Now Jack will go over the functionality of
		our app.

## Home
	
	Jack: 
		The functionality of app is divided into three steps:  Blazing the path of the trail,
		marking points of interest on the trail, and FINALLY hiking your trail, documenting your
		hikes, and sharing your trail, so that others can do the same.  So, let's start by blazing
		a trail!

## Blaze
	
	Jack: 
		Here we have the first 20 or so miles of the Appalachian trail, but it goes on much longer
		than that, so let's add onto it.  First we need to go the end of our trail, so we enter in
		the desired section [type type], and that takes us to the end.  We can now add on points by
		click [click click] or by latitude and longitude if we need extra precision.  As we're
		doing this, it updates our elevation profile, so we know how strenuous our trail is.  We
		can also drag markers and place additional markers between for extra fine tuning.  Now that 
		we have our trail, let's mark it!

## Mark
	
	Jack:
		On our mark page, we can add points of interests by placing a marker near the trail [
		click], which the app snaps onto the nearest trail section.  We can also place points by 
		distance along the trail.  Once we've placed our mark, we can enter additional information 
		about it including whether it's a shelter, water source, resupply, etc.  This also causes 
		it to appear on the elevation profile [scroll down].  Once we're happy with it, we can save 
		our point, and it turns green, to let us know that it's up-to-date.  And now Barry will 
		show us how to use the trail we've built.

## Hike
	
	Barry:
		Thank you, Jack.  Now that we have our trail, we can allow others to hike it or to hike it 
		ourselves.  The hike page allows us to see the completed trail and to access the 
		information added in the previous steps [click modal].  We create a hike by selecting a 
		section of the trail and giving it a name and a start and end date.  I already have two 
		hikes for this trail.  The first one was 2 days in november [click] and the second was last 
		week [click].  Now we want to add another hike to show that we've done the new section Jack 
		added.  So, we set our inteval [click], give our hike a name and some dates, and click 
		save... And a new hike shows up on our list.

## Outro

	Barry:
		And that's how you make a trail on the cranky cartographer.  If you would like to build a 
		trail or to hear about our app's features in more detail, please stop by our table.

	Jack:
		Thank you all very much.
