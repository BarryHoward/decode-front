Purpose/Goals:

The goal was to demonstrate the culmination the skills attained in our Iron Yard cohort.  Not only were we able to construct the entire website using AngularJS for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end, but we were also able to incorporate new technologies we learned during development such as the Google APIs and the Chart.JS library.  Using these tools, we were able expand our knowledge and exercise our creativy to create an application that was intuitive, functional, and -- most of all -- unique.
